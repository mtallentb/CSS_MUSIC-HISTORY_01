# Music History

### Part 1

#### Criteria

Create five options for the artist select element of any artist that you enjoy.
Create at least five options for the album select element. One, or more, album for each artist.
The links in the navigation bar don't need to link to anything just yet, you can use <a href="#">View music</a> for now
Pick your four favorite songs from the artists you have chosen and use the information for each in the list that's on the right-hand side. You can use h1 tags, div tags, section tags... whatever you like.


### Part 2

Use JavaScript arrays, loops, and innerHTML to show the music you love.

Use JavaScript to create a list of songs in the ```index.html``` file for your Music History project. Download the ```songs.js``` file, which contains an array of strings with song information.

Add one song to the beginning and the end of the array.
Loop over the array, and remove any words or characters that obviously don't belong.
Find and replace the ```>``` character in each item with a ```-``` character.
Add each string to the DOM in ```index.html``` in the main content area.
